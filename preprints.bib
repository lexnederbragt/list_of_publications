	abstract = {Whole genome duplication (WGD) has been a major evolutionary driver of increased genomic complexity in vertebrates, yet little is known about how selection operates on the resulting gene duplicates. Here, we present a draft genome assembly of a salmonid species, European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and use comparative genomics and transcriptomics to understand evolutionary consequences of WGD in the genome of salmonid ancestor {\textasciitilde}80 million years ago (Ss4R). We find evidence for lineage-specific rates in rediploidization and that {\textasciitilde}60\% of the Ss4R ohnologs have experienced different types of non-neutral evolution of tissue-specific gene expression regulation. Distinct selective pressures were associated with tissue type, biological function and selection pressure on protein coding sequence. Finally, our results indicate the role of adaptive divergence of Ss4R duplicates in the evolution of salmonid metabolism and identifies loss of purifying selection on one Ss4R ohnolog encoding a key chloride pump linked to the evolution of anadromy.},

	abstract = {Background: Increased availability of genome assemblies for non-model organisms has resulted in invaluable biological and genomic insight into numerous vertebrates including teleosts. The sequencing and assembly of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) genome and the genomes of many of its relatives (Gadiformes) demonstrated a shared loss 100 million years ago of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II genes. The recent publication of an improved version of the Atlantic cod genome assembly reported an extreme density of tandem repeats compared to other vertebrate genome assemblies. Highly contiguous genome assemblies are needed to further investigate the unusual immune system of the Gadiformes, and the high density of tandem repeats in this group. Results: Here, we have sequenced and assembled the genome of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) - a relative of Atlantic cod - using a combination of PacBio and Illumina reads. Comparative analyses uncover that the haddock genome contains an even higher density of tandem repeats outside and within protein coding sequences than Atlantic cod. Further, both species show an elevated number of tandem repeats in genes mainly involved in signal transduction compared to other teleosts. An in-depth characterization of the immune gene repertoire demonstrates a substantial expansion of MCHI in Atlantic cod compared to haddock. In contrast, the Toll-like receptors show a similar pattern of gene losses and expansions. For another gene family associated with the innate immune system, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), we find a large expansion common to all teleosts, with possible lineage-specific expansions in zebrafish, stickleback and the codfishes. Conclusions: The generation of a highly contiguous genome assembly of haddock revealed that the high density of short tandem repeats as well as expanded immune gene families is not unique to Atlantic cod - but most likely a feature common to all codfishes. A shared expansion of NLR genes in teleosts suggests that the NLRs have a more substantial role in the innate immunity of teleosts than other vertebrates. Moreover, we find that high copy number genes combined with variable genome assembly qualities may impede complete characterization, i.e. the number of NLRs might be underestimates in the different teleost species.},
