  abstract = {Recent advancements within state-of-the-art genomic tools and the generation of the first version of the Atlantic cod genome (Star et~al.,~2011) have proven to be valuable resources, improving our understanding of this species' biology. In this chapter we describe some aspects and implications of using these resources to identify genes and molecular pathways involved in Atlantic cod growth and development, as well as responses to nutritional changes, pathogens and other immune stimuli, and environmental stressors (e.g., temperature, stress, or pollutants). Additionally, we highlight the immunological puzzle of the Atlantic cod that lacks components of the adaptive immune system previously thought to be an essential feature of all jawed vertebrates. Furthermore, we present a new and substantially improved version of the Atlantic cod genome by combining recent developments within bioinformatics tools and the inclusion of data from both short as well as long read sequencing technologies. The new version of the Atlantic cod genome will be of high impact; facilitating applied functional genomics research to improve our understanding of gene function and variants affecting important phenotypic traits such as growth, sexual maturation, and disease resistance. Moreover, large-scale resequencing efforts of selected specimens would further aid in~deducing genomic effects of natural selection, identifying specific changes involved in local adaptation in the wild as well as in artificial selection related to breeding programs. This will allow for a systems biology approach where effects of a large number of gene variants (and regulatory pathways) can be causally related to phenotypic variation, for example, knowledge that will be crucial in selecting family material for the emerging cod aquaculture.},

  abstract = {The genome of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) published in 2011 was the first example of a teleost genome obtained using a pure high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology strategy, and the first large vertebrate genome generated by exclusively using Roche/454 sequencing technology. At the start of the sequencing project in 2009, two HTS technologies were available, the Roche/454 and Illumina technologies. Because of the longer read length of the Roche/454 technology and a wider range of suitable software utilizing those data at the time, we chose to use this technology for the first version of the Atlantic cod genome. In this chapter, we describe the process leading to the assembly and annotation of the first Atlantic cod genome. Since the release in 2011, spectacular developments in sequencing technologies and assembly software have allowed for a second, improved version of the Atlantic cod genome\textemdash which will be further described in the Atlantic cod genome chapter (Chapter~3). Although rather fragmented according to current standards, our first genome assembly has proven to be an important resource for the community\textemdash as illustrated by its extensive use in a wide range of studies and it catalyzing new projects and research funding.},
